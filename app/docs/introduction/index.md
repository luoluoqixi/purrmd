- **GFM Compatible** - Supports GitHub Flavored Markdown


## üôè Acknowledgments

Special thanks to these excellent projects for inspiration:

- [HyperMD](https://github.com/laobubu/HyperMD) - Pioneering WYSIWYG Markdown editing experience
- [ProseMark](https://github.com/jsimonrichard/ProseMark) - Reference implementation for CodeMirror6 Markdown
- [CodeMirror6](https://codemirror.net/) - Powerful editor core

Without the above projects, PurrMD would not exist.


## ‚ùì FAQ

**QÔºöSince CodeMirror6 already has ProseMark, why does this project exist?**

AÔºöThe initial purpose of this editor was to provide Markdown editing support for my personal note-taking app [LonaNote](https://github.com/luoluoqixi/lonanote). Implementing it myself makes it easier to extend and customize editor features.


**QÔºöDoes it support Vue/React?**

AÔºöThe CodeMirror editor is framework-agnostic and can be easily integrated with any frontend framework.
